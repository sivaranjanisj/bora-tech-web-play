# Bora Tech Academy - Basic Website Project

## About This Project
This is a simple **basic website** project I created as part of my learning journey. During this project, I learned how to:

- Apply HTML and CSS to structure and style web pages.
- Change colors, fonts, and alignments to make the website visually appealing.
- Experiment with layouts and interactive elements for better user experience.

I really enjoyed **practically applying** what I learned and seeing how small changes in code can **completely transform the look** of a webpage.

## Features
- Clean and simple layout suitable for a learning academy.
- Colorful and well-aligned sections to highlight different content.
- Navigation bar for easy access to different parts of the website.
- Footer with basic contact and information sections.
- Simple form created using a table for alignment.
- Responsive design (basic level).

## How I Made the Form with Table
I used a **HTML table** to organize the input fields neatly and applied **CSS to style it with colors**. This helped me practice aligning content properly and making it visually appealing.

| Field        | Description                                  |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Name        | Text input for user name                     |
| Email       | Input for user email                         |
| Message     | Multi-line text input for user message      |
| Submit      | Button to send form data                     |

I also experimented with **colors, borders, and background styles** to make the form more attractive and readable.

## What I Learned
- How to structure forms using HTML tables.
- How to use CSS to change **colors, borders, and alignment**.
- How small design tweaks make a big difference in user experience.
- Hands-on experience in creating a project from scratch.

## Future Improvements
- Make the form fully responsive for mobile devices.
- Add interactive validation for inputs.
- Include hover effects and animations for better user engagement.
